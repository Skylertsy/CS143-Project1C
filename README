Eric did most of the front-end HTML and Javascript coding. He also wrote the CSS
for the website and wrote the PHP to add information to the database.

Kevin designed the search interface and implemented the commenting adding functionality. He also implemented some of the code that accessed the database to show information to the user. 

One thing that we could possibly improve on would be to work in the same room for some of the project, as opposed to doing all of our collaboration remotely. It might make it easier to work out some of the bugs that we find. It also means that we'll be more up to date on what the other person is working on.
